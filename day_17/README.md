# Day 17
You think Santa does all his work in one night! NO NO NO! The real magic of Santa is logistics! He and his elves work hard throughout the year to make Christmas Eve go flawlessly (well, almost flawless, somehow he just keeps missing impoverished kids houses). Part of his work is storing caches of presents throughout the world! That makes things easier on him and his reindeer. Sadly, since Santa got Covid and almost died (China has never forgiven him for ripping off so many of their products), his lungs just haven't been the same! And since Utah's air is just so bad sometimes, he'd like to know when would be the best and worst times to visit. 

For this challenge, use the air quality CSV to find:
- When the best 7 consecutive days to visit Utah
    - This is done by getting the average per day by county, then averaging that for a summary of all of Utah
- How bad are the worst 7 days?
